<!-- When global.auth=none in the CR yaml (meaning the AUTH_TYPE env var to this container is set to "none"), the server
     is NOT instructed to check for a JWT in the request header.  This can simplify setup and early dev/test (such as for
     a new client UI), but is not intended to be used in a production deployment.  The only difference between "none" and
     "basic" is whether the following mpJwt line is commented out or not.
    <mpJwt id="stockTraderJWT" audiences="${JWT_AUDIENCE}" issuer="${JWT_ISSUER}" keyName="jwtSigner" ignoreApplicationAuthMethod="false" expiry="12h" sslRef="defaultSSLConfig"/>
